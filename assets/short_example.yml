# This is a YAML file, so all content must be configured per YAML specification.

# This short_example.yml file will generate 270 images in total. On a decent graphics card with SD 1.5, expect 5-10 minutes to run.

# This key is required configuration of the grid itself.

                 This is to demonstrate the concept of how the infinite-axis grid system works.
                 This description here demonstrates multi-line YAML strings.

    # Optionally specify base parameters. If not set, it will use whatever parameters you have in the WebUI.
    # These can be overridden by an axis.

# "axes" is the root key of the list of axes
